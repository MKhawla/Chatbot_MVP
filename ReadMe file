## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Modern web browser

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd travel-information-chatbot
```

2. Install Node.js dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

## Running the Application

### Python Chatbot (Command Line Interface)

To run the command-line version of the chatbot:

```bash
python3 src/chatbot.py
```

You can then interact with the chatbot by typing queries like:
- "What's the route from Paris to Lyon?"
- "How can I travel from Lyon to Paris?"

### Web Interface (React Frontend)

To start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

## Technical Details

### Backend (Python)

The Python implementation consists of three main components:

1. **TransportAPI**: Simulates real-world transportation APIs
   - Traffic data
   - Train schedules
   - Route information

2. **RouteOptimizer**: Handles route calculations
   - Traffic analysis
   - Train schedule optimization
   - Travel time estimation

3. **TravelChatbot**: Processes user queries
   - Natural language understanding
   - Multi-modal route suggestions
   - Response formatting

### Frontend (React + TypeScript)

The web interface is built with:
- React 18
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Vite build tool

## Current Limitations

- Limited to routes between Paris and Lyon
- Uses simulated data instead of real API connections
- Basic natural language processing

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with real transportation APIs
- Support for more cities and routes
- Advanced natural language processing
- Real-time updates and notifications
- Mobile application support
- Weather data integration
- Fare comparison and booking integration
